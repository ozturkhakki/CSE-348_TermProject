# CSE-348_TermProject
This is a project I have done for CSE-348 (Database Management Systems) course for my university education.

The project takes example names for people, cities, districts, markets, etc. from CSV files under the directory csv_files and uses them to create and fill a random database. Afterwards, the project uses this random database to get the results required.

I have used php, mysql, html, javascript, css and ajax for this project.
